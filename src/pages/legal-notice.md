### Address for Service of Process
For reasons of privacy and personal safety, the full service address is **not published online**. It will be provided upon legitimate and legally justified request (e.g., in accordance with § 5 DDG).

This decision is based on increasing risks of digital violence (online harassment, doxing, targeted hate campaigns) – phenomena documented by organisations such as [HateAid gGmbH](https://hateaid.org/digitale-gewalt) and activists in the network policy domain of [Die Linke](https://www.bundestag.de/presse/hib/kurzmeldungen-897400). Further, the [Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/Cyber-Sicherheitslage/Methoden-der-Cyber-Kriminalitaet/Digitale-Gewalt/digitale-gewalt.html) recommends minimizing exposure of personal data in public online spaces to reduce vulnerability.

Despite careful creation, no liability is assumed for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content under § 7 (1) DDG.
